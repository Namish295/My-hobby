        <h1>My hobby cricket</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My hobby is playing cricket. Cricket is my favorite sport. When I get some free time on weekends,I go outside with my brother and father and play cricket. Cricket is the game which requires physical fitness. The running between the wickets, fielding within the ground and stress bearing during batting and fielding make my body fit and mind fresh. So, after playing cricket when I study, I can better grab the concepts. I also become delighted by playing cricket because I donâ€™t waste my mind sitting in front of a computer or playing video games. Instead, I do some healthy activity. On every Sunday evening, I have a lot of free time. Mostly, I play cricket at that time. I have a leather cricket bat and ball. I also got another benefit of playing cricket as cricket is a phisical excercise it keeps our body mind and spirit fit healthy and fresh so I love playing cricket.</p>
